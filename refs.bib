The designer works in an interactive Very High Level programming environment which provides a very fast concept/implement/view iteration cycle.Naturalistic visual complexity is built up by composition of non-linear functions, as opposed to the more conventional texture mapping or growth model algorithms. Powerful primitives are included for creating controlled stochastic effects. We introduce the concept of "solid texture" to the field of CGI.We have used this system to create very convincing representations of clouds, fire, water, stars, marble, wood, rock, soap films and crystal. The algorithms created with this paradigm are generally extremely fast, highly realistic, and asynchronously parallelizable at the pixel level.},

	publisher = {University of California at Davis},
	address = {USA},
	abstract = {This dissertation provides the theoretical basis and implementation details for a complete and practical real-time voxel-based terrain rendering system. We first present a modified Marching Cubes algorithm designed to eliminate choices arising from ambiguities in the original algorithm and its successors in order to facilitate a faster implementation and to simplify the design of a level-of-detail algorithm. The modified Marching Cubes algorithm is extended to operate on voxel data at multiple resolutions in such a way that triangle meshes produced at all levels of detail correctly match geometrical features. We introduce a robust method for seamlessly joining voxel-based terrain meshes of different levels of detail and establish a transition structure that both simplifies the triangulation problem and eliminates the potential for shading artifacts. Finally, we discuss methods for applying texture maps and advanced shading techniques to voxel-based terrain meshes. These methods are designed to be fast and compatible with the widest possible range of graphics hardware across multiple platforms.},

Fractal analysis appears to capture some “new” information that traditional parameters do not contain.

Interpolation artifacts of DEMs and anisotropy create additional difficulties in the computation of fractal dimensions. Fractal dimensions appear to be spatially variable over landscapes. The region-dependent spatial variation of the dimension has more practical significance than the scale-dependent spatial variation.

The application of fractals to landscape analysis is a developing and immature field and much of the theoretical rigour of fractal geometry has not yet been exploited.
